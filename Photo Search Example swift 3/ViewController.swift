                         //so, knowing that it's String, Any, we can call the string to get the Value

                         //when do we use Dictionary?

                         etc
                         //so the first value is String, this is the Key to find the value
                         //the second value is aan Int, this is the value the key will return when we call Items["devastator"]
                         //we can also have something lik this...
                         items

                            item

                                id: 501
                                damage: 3d8+1
                            },
                            {
                                name:"stormbringer"

                         so... 
                         items is the KEY for the dictionary
                         so we have this...
                         let items = variable["items"] as? [String: Any] //Why String? because we identify it as "items"
                         //why Any? because we will convert that Any into the object that is in the next cast
                         let ietmArray = items["item"] as? [[String: Any]] //This means... array of Dictionary
                         //Why array? because we have various items separated by comma
                         //why Dictionary? because we have Key:Value, which is name:"devastator", id:501, and more
                         do you understand any of it?// i Understand, maybe, 60% of it. you explained it well
                         tell me, what is this? 
                         
                         item
                         {
                         name: "devastator"
                         id: 501
                         damage: 3d8+1
                         },
                         {
                         name: "devastator"
                         id: 501
                         damage: 3d8+1
                         },
                         first we must ask, is it an array?
                         the thing is, this is json, in json, you can have objects separated by comma,
                         what json does is to write the objects into a file, and you must parse them into your language (swift, c++, java)  in the format you desire.
                        we know that we must PARSE IT as an array because it has various items separated by comma
                 
                         now, each of this objects has what? ID and Any type yes
                         so is it a dictionary? an array? an array of dictionary? hmm tricky. Its a array of dict yes
                         because 
                         1- various items
                         2- has key:value 
                         so to declare a dictionary we must do
                         as [String:Any]
                         to declare an array we must do
                         as [type]
                         result: [[String:Any]] (array of Dictionary)
